ProxyBound v4.5
===============

  ProxyBound is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions
  in dynamically linked programs via a preloaded DLL and redirects the
  connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.
  
  It's based on proxychains-ng by rofl0r
  
How it works:
=============

  this program works only on dynamically linked programs.
  also both proxybound and the program to call must use
  the same dynamic linker (i.e. same libc).
  why ? because in order to hook to libc functions like
  connect(), dynamic loader facilities are used, namely
  dl_sym() and LD_PRELOAD.

Install:
========

  ./configure
  make
  [optional] sudo make install

  if you dont install, you can use proxybound from the build directory
  like this: ./proxybound -f src/proxybound.conf telnet google.com 80

Changelog:
==========

  Version 4.5:
  - Changing the name to ProxyBound

  Version 4.4:
  - Import security issue fix CVE-2015-3887 

Configuration:
==============

  Proxybound config file in following order:

  1)	File listed in environment variable ${PROXYBOUND_CONF_FILE} or
    	provided as a -f argument to proxybound script or binary.
  2)	./proxybound.conf
  3)	$(HOME)/.proxybound/proxybound.conf
  4)	/etc/proxybound.conf

Usage Example:
==============

  $ proxybound telnet targethost.com

  in this example it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies)
  specified by proxybound.conf

  $ proxybound -f /etc/proxybound-other.conf targethost2.com

  in this example it will use different configuration file then proxybound.conf 
  to connect to targethost2.com host.

  $ proxyresolv targethost.com

  in this example it will resolve targethost.com through proxy(or chained proxies)
  specified by proxybound.conf
