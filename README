ProxyBound v5.0
===============

  ProxyBound is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions
  in dynamically linked programs via a preloaded DLL and redirects the
  connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies. This is based on 
  proxychains-ng by rofl0r, proxychains by haad and torsocks by dgoulet
  
How it works:
=============

  Proxybound hook libc functions like connect(), dynamic loader 
  facilities are used, namely dl_sym() and LD_PRELOAD thus
  dynamically linked programs are required.
  
Used environment variable:
==========================

- PROXYBOUND_CONF_FILE:     Path to config file
- PROXYBOUND_QUIET_MODE:    Quiet mode (1 or 0)
- PROXYBOUND_SOCKS5_HOST:   Specify unique socks 5 proxy to use 
- PROXYBOUND_SOCKS5_PORT:   Socks 5 port
- PROXYBOUND_FORCE_DNS:     Force dns requests through (1 or 0)
- PROXYBOUND_ALLOW_LEAKS:   Not yet implemented (Allow unproxyfied protocols "UDP/ICMP/RAW")

Install:
========

  ./configure
  make
  [optional] sudo make install

  if you dont install, you can use proxybound from the build directory
  like this: ./proxybound -f src/proxybound.conf telnet google.com 80

  Version 4.5:

  Version 4.4:

Configuration:
==============

  Proxybound config file in following order:

  1)	File listed in environment variable ${PROXYBOUND_CONF_FILE} or
    	provided as a -f argument to proxybound script or binary.
  2)	./proxybound.conf
  3)	$(HOME)/.proxybound/proxybound.conf
  4)	/etc/proxybound.conf

Usage Example:
==============

  $ export PROXYBOUND_QUIET_MODE="1"
  $ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libproxybound.so
  $ export PROXYBOUND_CONF_FILE=/etc/proxybound.conf
  $ telnet targethost.com
  
  In this example it will run telnet through proxy without using proxybound binary

  $ proxybound telnet targethost.com

  In this example it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies) specified by proxybound.conf

  $ proxybound -f /etc/proxybound-other.conf targethost2.com

  In this example it will use different configuration file then proxybound.conf to connect to targethost2.com host.

  $ proxyresolv targethost.com

  In this example it will resolve targethost.com through proxy(or chained proxies) specified by proxybound.conf
